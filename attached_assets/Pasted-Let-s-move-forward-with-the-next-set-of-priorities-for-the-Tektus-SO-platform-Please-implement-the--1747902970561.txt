Let’s move forward with the next set of priorities for the Tektus.SO platform. Please implement the following features:

---

✅ 1. Finalize Google Calendar Integration  
- Complete the existing calendar integration for the Clients Center and Sales Team modules  
- When scheduling a meeting (via task or pipeline stage), allow selecting:
  • Title, date, time, client email, description, and responsible user  
- Create and sync events directly to Google Calendar using the logged-in user’s credentials (OAuth)  
- Save event IDs and sync status in the database for later updates or deletion

✅ 2. Build Kanban Interfaces  
- **Crisis Management Module**:
  • Create a drag-and-drop Kanban view with phases like “In Crisis”, “Resolving”, “Resolved”  
  • Each card should display the client name, issue summary, priority, responsible team member  
- **Legal Module – Legal Cases**:
  • Kanban view with stages like “Open”, “In Review”, “In Process”, “Resolved”  
  • Add fields: case title, client, internal owner, documents attached, status update log  
  • Allow comments and attachments on each legal case

✅ 3. Expand the Legal Module with Contract Templates  
- Add a section for reusable contract templates  
- Allow admin to upload .docx or .pdf templates and categorize them by type (Service, NDA, Termination)  
- Include a viewer and download option  
- Make it possible to duplicate a template into a contract assigned to a client

✅ 4. Implement Campaign Management Interface in Traffic Center  
- Build a visual dashboard for paid traffic campaigns  
- Separate by platform: Meta Ads and Google Ads  
- Each campaign should include: campaign name, client, objective, daily budget, current spend, CTR, ROAS, responsible media buyer  
- Add filters by client, status, and platform  
- Allow quick edit and status toggle

---

✅ 5. Add Document Repository in Administration Module  
- Create a centralized file manager  
- Allow categorized upload (PDFs, slides, spreadsheets, etc.) with tags like “HR”, “Finance”, “Legal”, “Strategy”  
- Support preview and download  
- Include upload metadata: uploader, upload date, file type, access permission (all, restricted)

Please confirm once these components are implemented and live. This will complete key operational layers of Tektus.SO and help us validate automation workflows, role-based access, and multi-department collaboration.
