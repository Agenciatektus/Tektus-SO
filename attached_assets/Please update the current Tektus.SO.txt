Please update the current Tektus.SO project structure to reflect the following modular workspace layout, based on a fully functional work OS for marketing agencies. The system should have a left sidebar with expandable sections (accordion or nested), each containing the described internal modules and views. Each page should follow the existing dark theme with green/teal accents.

Structure each module as a dynamic React route (with role-based access), and use TypeScript with Prisma for backend schema. Persist the modularity using folder structure and reusable layouts.
